Comments aren't drawn along a link!


add %t option to format SNMP TimeTicks

thumb2 file - 48x48px thumb to show in map management screen.
Include note about timezone stuff in docs
DONE make a (no map yet) thumbnail


FIXED/DONE Imagemap seems all wrong in editor?? - write a 'draw imagemap' function

per-map debugging - needs UI to enable!
map scheduling - needs UI
consolidated map-properties page in UI? (variable settings, plus schedule, plus debug, plus runtime info, etc)

FONTDEFINE can't tell if GD font is wrong-endian?
Off-by-one in angled VIAs (only in one direction?? - test simple-link-5a.conf)
Change non-scale colour handling to go into another colour table - no 'special'
Winding order problem (I think) with sharp-angled vias - see conf_via3.conf
DONE   USESCALE absolute not in WriteConfig
Use the Colour class for all colours.
KEYBG/KEYOUTLINE/KEYTEXTCOLOR per-scale

Rewrite Cacti integration and editor manual pages

Move scale stuff into WeatherMapScale

THIS IS CORRECT poller_output still runs with map-update-period = 0
entries in weathermap_data are never expired
collect usage_stats into an .xml file next to each map file
standalone version of the cacti map browser
DONE   track runtime per map
DONE   improve cron string parsing
improve usage_stats to cover non-regexp config
DONE allow IMAGEOUTPUTFILE/HTMLOUTPUTFILE/IMAGEURI to make a copy of the final image in Cacti mode http://forums.cacti.net/viewtopic.php?t=36279
improve usage_stats to cover things other than keywords
DONE more efficient ReadConfig - 50% of runtime!
SORTOFDONE very simplified link drawing for classical no-via links.
DONE Move imagemap stuff so that each node and link holds it's own imagemap shapes - saves a lot of sorting and searching

some things from the wishlist:
Some kind of shorthand for 'last non-relative node'? Then the sub chunks WOULD be generic
DONE   KEYBGCOLOR none
DONE   KEYOUTLINECOLOR none
{node:this_link_a:name}
TAG + {node:tagged:name}
Cacti editor picker - if it's not traffic_in/traffic_out, let you pick the DSes
Editor picker - plugin-supplied picker listings - allow for Zabbix,Zenoss,Cricket,Groundwork,MRTG,Orion,Smokeping,WUG etc to supply useful picker info

MOSTLYDONE!   Boost/poller_output support

DONE!   INBWFORMAT/OUTBWFORMAT
DONE!   Unidirectional links
DONE! Fixes for Cacti 0.8.7 changes
BUG: RRD line with one NaN and one good value should still be a good line. -> Actual bug is that -1 is a magic value. Switch to NULL for 'no value'!
FIXED BUG: poller_output should degrade when no new updates arrive, somehow.
FIXED BUG: cacti-picker.php needs to include global.php if there is one, in preference to config.php (0.8.7 compat)

------------------------------------------------------------
(php-rrdtool support?)
(Editor NG) -> IE6 styling and imagemap updating is totally wrong
Extra DS for WUG, Nagios
USESCALE can use any variable - USESCALE scalename {node:this:cactihost_latency}
Finish Artificial Icons

DONE Verify rrdtool DS is OK

-----------------

Background image links: http://art.gnome.org/backgrounds/abstract/
Background image generator: http://splintax.blogspot.com/2006/01/starfish-automatically-generated.html

FIXED BUG: USESCALE none produces an error - if no scale called 'none' is defined, it is not an error.
FIXED BUG: COMMENTPOS 0 breaks things. LABELPOS 0 probably does too (binary search problem)
FIXED BUG: WriteConfig KEYPOS *STILL* produces invalid config?

DONE RRD DS should look for lines with valid data *in the named DS*, not ALL valid.

DONE WriteConfig should optionally just return a string (so the editor can fetch a config chunk)
DONE WriteConfig should optionally write the contents of a variable in place of the normal config (so the editor can update a chunk)

DONE Work out NODE-drawing code so that the bg colour is known earlier, so artificial icons can use it.

DONE Finish scale-drawing changes so that the cached image is stored somewhere.

Editor - make the link offset radio buttons work (what about numeric offsets?)

Refactor scale/colour picking stuff, so we can get inscalekey/outscalekey early

Cacti poller_output support (Boost) - lots of reworking

Editor QuickWin(tm): Upload images
Editor QuickWin(tm): Grid Snap

Error Codes - error code linked to explanatory page on website. Getting tired of explaining the english errors again and again!

Memory Leaks?

RRDserv-compatible target?  rrdfile.rrd@hostname:portnumber   rrdremote:host:port:file.rrd (need to learn PHP sockets)

php-rrdtool support in rrd DS plugin

Cacti THold DS plugin
Cacti Manage DS plugin (if I can get Manage to work)
Cacti Report DS plugin?
WhatsUp Gold 8 & 11 DS plugins
Nagios DS plugin

BWLABELS nonzero   to hide bwlabel boxes for (exactly) zero values. (grangenet weathermap)

Node width/height adjustment? Maybe some special ICONs? :-
    ICON 300 400 box  # use existing size thingy. 'box' just draws a bigger box
	ICON 48 48 nink # draw a nink

INBWFORMAT/OUTBWFORMAT - ProcessString strings for the bwlabels
- Some way to format BWLABELs? I want milliseconds, someone else wanted  "x% of yMb"
- should be something like BWLABELIN and BWLABELOUT. Each one needs different vars.
- This is starting to get ugly.

DONE Refactor draw_curve/draw_label - store the spine in the link?
DONE  - allow for tangential labels, moving comments, etc, without making draw_curve even bigger

DONE INCOMMENTPOS/OUTCOMMENTPOS
DONE Tangential Labels
DONE Use PHP_CompatInfo to get definitive requirements
DONE "subtractive aggregation" prefix a - to a target

DONE Editor QuickWin(tm): Pick any defined font? (like the current image picker)
DONE Editor QuickWin(tm): Moving a node rotates VIAs - needed in AJAX editor anyway.
FIXED SET not inherited for links or nodes?

Things below this line are not urgent
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Move to seperate runtime vars from config vars in WeatherMapItem - makes WriteConfig and editor UI easier.
* ReadConfig sets config vars
* some kind of GetConfig is used by anything that needs to read these
* the runtime state is NOT the config vars
* WriteConfig writes the config vars
- should a pre/post plugin be allowed to alter the config vars? (e.g. snap to grid)

DEAD Decide which internal properties are visible through ProcessString, and limit/rename them.

DEAD Move to using RRD xml output, to avoid some text-parsing problems

Nagios target

Cacti data target (use data_id instead of rrd path - helps with Boost?)

Editor: wierd redraw bug switching to xy sometimes. Some kind of preloader?

Niels Baggesen: BWLABELS BOTH (!)
Ueli: Use rrdtool extension if possible
DONE: TFC: multipoint links, or curved, or parallel?

DONE Alex Soares de Moura: arrow outlines on/off/colour

DONE Me: overhaul arrow drawing generally, so I understand it properly! :-)

Editor: Scale editor
DONE Editor: font selection
Editor:  other colours (background, link outline)
DONE Editor: Cacti source picker
Editor: Image management (backgrounds, icons)

NOT DONE RIGHT Editor: Help text - onfocus & onblur handlers for all form elements.

NON-BUG sizedebug doesn't work in editor?? did before... maybe only in PHP4 (of course)

DONE Some memory-usage monitoring would make debugging configs easier.

FIXED Map Cycle mode broken in IE?

DONE Cacti Host Status target

DONE length for horizonal/vertical scales:  KEYSTYLE horizontal 300   (the width is auto, based on font, isn't it?)

DONE  Make a note available with the percentage bandwidth, so it can appear in comments/labels
DONE --> calculate percentage bandwidth BEFORE drawing anything (before the post-process?), so it's universally available.

DONE ProcessString for TARGET, based on hints but not notes.

DONE --define x=y option for CLI

DONE ProcessString for INFOURL, OVERLIBGRAPH?
- Not TARGET? (any plugin could put strings into a command line for '!' plugin) 

NON-BUG weathermap-cacti-rebuild.php has cacti-path hardcoded!
