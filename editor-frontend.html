                <h3>Interactive Map Editor</h3>

                <p>Welcome to the new PHP Weathermap Editor. Just like the old editor,
                "<em>This editor is not finished! There are many features of Weathermap
                that you will be missing out on if you choose to use the editor
                only</em>". </p>

                <p>Obviously the whole point of rewriting the editor is that there are
                <em>less</em> of these features, but there will still be some. If you
                need fine-control over some aspects of the map then you should consider
                reading the config reference, and breaking out Notepad/vi. It's not so
                scary.</p>

                <p>For the best experience of the editor, you might want to maximise
                your browser window. The editor is most-tested in FireFox 2.0, but
                should work in most modern browsers.</p>
